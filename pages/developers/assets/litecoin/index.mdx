## Supported Operations

- [Get Address](./get-address): Derive and display Litecoin addresses on your KeepKey device
- [Validate Address](./validate-address): Verify if a Litecoin address is valid
- [Send to Address](./send-to-address): Create and sign transactions to send Litecoin
- [Transaction History](./tx-history): View the history of your Litecoin transactions

## Quick Start Example

Here's a basic example of how to connect to your KeepKey and retrieve a Litecoin address:

```typescript
import { KeepKeySdk } from '@keepkey/keepkey-sdk';

const initializeKeepKey = async () => {
  try {
    // Initialize SDK
    const sdk = await KeepKeySdk.create({
      apiKey: "my-litecoin-app",
      pairingInfo: {
        name: "Litecoin Wallet Demo",
        imageUrl: "https://example.com/litecoin-logo.png",
        url: window.location.origin,
      }
    });
    
    // Litecoin Native SegWit (BIP84): m/84'/2'/0'/0/0
    const litecoinParams = {
      addressNList: [0x80000054, 0x80000002, 0x80000000, 0, 0],
      coin: 'Litecoin',
      scriptType: 'p2wpkh', // Native SegWit
      showDisplay: true
    };
    
    // Get Litecoin address
    const ltcAddress = await sdk.ltcGetAddress({ 
      litecoinGetAddress: litecoinParams 
    });
    
    console.log("Your Litecoin address:", ltcAddress);
    
    return { sdk, address: ltcAddress };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error connecting to KeepKey:", error);
    throw error;
  }
};

// Run the example
initializeKeepKey();
```
