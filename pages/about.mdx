# KeepKeys History

### The Origins of KeepKey

Founded in 2014, KeepKey emerged in a turbulent time for cryptocurrency. Following the infamous Mt. Gox breach, which was the largest exchange hack at the time and lost half a billion dollars of customers funds. The Bitcoin community was determined to innovation solutions.

This makes KeepKey the second oldest hardware wallet.

## The ShapeShift Acquisition (2017)

In 2017, KeepKey was acquired by [ShapeShift](https://shapeshift.com), led by Erik Voorhees. ShapeShift revolutionized the crypto landscape with its groundbreaking non-custodial swapping model, enabling users to trade assets without KYC or account requirements.

The synergy between ShapeShift and KeepKey was clear: integrating ShapeShift’s vision into KeepKey’s hardware wallet would create an innovative solution that combined security and convenience. This partnership made KeepKey the first hardware wallet to enable direct, on-device asset swaps, allowing users to trade securely from their wallet.

## The Thorchain Mission: Decentralized Swaps and KeepKey’s Evolution

Amid these challenges, KeepKey’s leadership, including Erik Voorhees and technical lead Matt Highlander, turned to [Thorchain](https://thorchain.org)

— a decentralized protocol for cross-chain, non-custodial swaps.

Aligning with Thorchain’s mission, KeepKey became the first hardware wallet to integrate RUNE, Thorchain’s native asset. This strategic alignment positioned KeepKey as a leader in decentralized asset management and trading.

### Milestones in Thorchain Integration:
- **2018**: Thorchain development begins, pioneering decentralized cross-chain swaps.
- **December 2020**: KeepKey integrates RUNE for secure storage and transactions.
- **April 2021**: ChaosNet launch enables live decentralized swaps through Thorchain.
- **April 2022**: Thorchain mainnet goes live, unlocking robust decentralized trading capabilities.

### Security and Innovation:
KeepKey’s team developed firmware-integrated swaps, becoming the first hardware wallet to embed Thorchain swaps directly within its core technology. This innovation solidified KeepKey’s leadership in hardware wallet security, enabling seamless and secure decentralized trading.
