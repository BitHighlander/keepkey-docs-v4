# The KeepKey Story

## Origins and Innovation

Founded in 2014, KeepKey emerged during a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency history. Following the infamous Mt. Gox breach—which resulted in the loss of half a billion dollars in customer funds—the Bitcoin community sought innovative security solutions. This mission established KeepKey as the second-oldest hardware wallet in the industry, setting a foundation for secure cryptocurrency storage.

## Strategic Growth

### ShapeShift Acquisition (2017)

In 2017, [ShapeShift](https://shapeshift.com), under Erik Voorhees's leadership, acquired KeepKey. ShapeShift had revolutionized the crypto landscape with its groundbreaking non-custodial swapping model, enabling users to trade assets without KYC requirements or account creation.

The synergy between the companies proved powerful:
- First hardware wallet with integrated asset swaps
- Direct on-device trading capabilities
- Seamless security and convenience fusion
- Enhanced user sovereignty

### Regulatory Challenges

As ShapeShift's success grew, increased regulatory oversight forced the adoption of KYC measures. This shift marked a departure from the company's founding principles and highlighted the ongoing tension between centralized regulation and decentralized finance.

Under the guidance of Erik Voorhees and technical lead Matt Highlander, KeepKey formed a strategic alliance with [Thorchain](https://thorchain.org)—a decentralized protocol enabling cross-chain, non-custodial swaps. This partnership established KeepKey as the first hardware wallet to integrate RUNE, Thorchain's native asset.
