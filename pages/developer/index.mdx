## About

- Open source
- No secure elements or proprietary embedded code
- LGPLv3 license
- Written in C
- Deterministic builds [https://docs.keepkey.info/4-Security/Verify-Firmware]

### Toolchain Installation

Install Docker Community Edition from:
`https://www.docker.com/get-docker`

```bash
$ docker pull kktech/firmware:v5-beta
```

### Clone the Source

The sources can be obtained from GitHub:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:keepkey/keepkey-firmware.git
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Build

To build the firmware using the Docker container, use the provided script:

```bash
$ ./scripts/build/docker/device/release.sh
```

## Verifying Published Binaries

Compare the hash of a given tagged build:

```bash
$ git checkout v6.2.0
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ ./scripts/build/docker/device/release.sh
$ tail -c +257 ./bin/firmware.keepkey.bin | shasum -a 256
```

With that of the [signed v6.2.0 binary on GitHub](https://github.com/keepkey/keepkey-firmware/releases/download/v6.2.0/firmware.keepkey.bin), ignoring signatures and firmware metadata:

```bash
$ tail -c +257 firmware.keepkey.bin | shasum -a 256
```

Then inspect the metadata itself by comparing against the structure described [here](https://github.com/keepkey/keepkey-firmware/blob/f20484804285decfacceb71519ae83bc18f2266f/include/keepkey/board/memory.h#L55):

```bash
$ head -c +256 signed_firmware.bin | xxd -
```

### Caveats

1. v6.2.2 and v6.3.0 had an issue with build reproducibility. See [#212](https://github.com/keepkey/keepkey-firmware/issues/212).
2. As of v6.1.0 and later, we started prepending empty slots for signatures as part of the build, and prior firmwares were emitted without that metadata section. See [87b9ebb84](https://github.com/keepkey/keepkey-firmware/commit/87b9ebb846b241e6357f296e37fd29808ddfa51a)
