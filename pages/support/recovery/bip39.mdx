#Bip39




Prior to bip39 bitcoind would save keypairs into a file. it would save to disk and you would have to save that file, if you lost that file you lost your money
generated to many addresses? need to save that file again

lost device? lost funds

corrupted file?
lost


Bip39 (and bip32) allows a durable and stateless recovery method for your wallet

It is the most important tool for self custody. its innovation is critical to prevent lost funds that haunted the ecosystem prior to its prevelence

it also is how you can
