# Troubleshooting Connecting your KeepKey

Are you a new or returning user to KeepKey? are you having trouble figuring out there to start? this is the guide for you!

_WARNING: There are many browser extensions and fake software that claim to be KeepKey and are actually scams! they will ask for Mnemonics. any software that asks for a Mnemonics without going through the recovery process is a scam._

## Getting Started

Many of our users are coming back after not using their KeepKey’s for a long time. This guide is for users who for any reason are not able to connect or access their KeepKey Device.

Most of our users have used their KeepKey’s with either shapeshift.com or perhaps if you are an even older, the KeepKey Browser Extension.

If this is the case you MUST update the firmware on your device. To do this you must use an Updater App.

## Introducing KeepKey Desktop

If you are a new or returning user the first step is always to verify you have the latest firmware.
