# Troubleshooting Connecting your KeepKey

Are you a new or returning user to KeepKey? are you having trouble figuring out there to start? this is the guide for you!

_WARNING: There are many browser extensions and fake software that claim to be KeepKey and are actually scams! they will ask for Mnemonics. any software that asks for a Mnemonics without going through the recovery process is a scam._

## Getting Started

Many of our users are coming back after not using their KeepKey’s for a long time. This guide is for users who for any reason are not able to connect or access their KeepKey Device.

Most of our users have used their KeepKey’s with either shapeshift.com or perhaps if you are an even older, the KeepKey Browser Extension.

If this is the case you MUST update the firmware on your device. To do this you must use an Updater App.

## Introducing KeepKey Desktop

If you are a new or returning user the first step is always to verify you have the latest firmware.

# Step One. Identify the software you are using or intending to be using.

Understanding All the KeepKey Clients

* (**Production**) KeepKey Desktop: The replacement for KeepKey updater, written by KeepKey. [KeepKey Desktop](https://github.com/keepkey/keepkey-desktop/releases)
* (**Legacy**) KeepKey Updater: an application maintained by KeepKey originally written by ShapeShift for updating KeepKeys.[Download link](https://github.com/keepkey/keepkey-updater/releases/tag/v2.1.4)

### What version do I run?
* windows: ******.exe
* linux: *******.AppImage
* OSX: *******.dmg

(On Windows you will need to click past warnings! Windows is not friendly to publishers outside of their app store)

Linux users:
Your Host machine must have valid USB drivers. This is generally only an issue for linux machines. Linux users may need to adjust their UDEV permissions. documented [here](https://github.com/keepkey/udev-rules)

OSX users:

OSX is very strict to its USB permissions. You MUST enable USB permissions to allow Keepkey Desktop to communicate with the USB device! It is these strict permissions why KeepKey is NOT usable of IOS mobile devices or Tablets!

# TroubleShooting Connections

1. Your KeepKey must be on firmware greater than 6.1.0
2. You must be using a web browser with webUSB support. This is limited to Brave/Chrome and excludes firefox and safari
3. Your KeepKey can not be connected to any other web browsers tab via USB. For instance only the first tab opened with app.shapeshift.com will be able to connect to the device. (It is recommended to close all tabs)
4. You must not be running KeepKey Desktop OR the KeepKey updater app. It is possible these services are running in the background. Be sure to check your menu trays and perhaps check running tasks to stop them.
5. Your USB cable must be solid and without damage. It is not uncommon for USB cables to fail. Just because a USB cable can transmit power and Power on a KeepKey does NOT guarantee that the data connection is solid and without issues.
6. Your Host machine must have valid USB drivers. This is generally only an issue for linux machines. Linux users may need to adjust their UDEV permissions. documented here
7. Linux users may need to chmod +x keepkey desktop to use it

### Electrum Users:

Add python lib
```
python3 -m pip install keepkey
