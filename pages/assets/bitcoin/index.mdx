# Bitcoin (BTC)

![Bitcoin Logo](https://pioneers.dev/coins/bitcoin.png)

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. It introduced blockchain technology and remains the most valuable digital asset.
</Callout>

## Features

- Secure Bitcoin storage on your KeepKey hardware wallet
- Support for multiple address formats (Legacy, SegWit, Native SegWit)
- Transaction signing and verification
- Custom fees and UTXO selection
- BIP39 seed phrase backup and recovery

## Specifications

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Symbol | BTC |
| Decimal Places | 8 |
| Network Type | UTXO |
| Default Derivation Path | m/84'/0'/0'/0/0 (Native SegWit) |
| Address Format Support | Legacy (P2PKH), SegWit (P2SH-P2WPKH), Native SegWit (P2WPKH) |

## Derivation Paths

KeepKey supports multiple address formats for Bitcoin, each with a different derivation path:

| Format | Purpose | Path Format | Example |
|--------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Legacy (P2PKH) | BIP44 | m/44'/0'/0'/0/0 | [0x8000002c, 0x80000000, 0x80000000, 0, 0] |
| SegWit (P2SH-P2WPKH) | BIP49 | m/49'/0'/0'/0/0 | [0x80000031, 0x80000000, 0x80000000, 0, 0] |
| Native SegWit (P2WPKH) | BIP84 | m/84'/0'/0'/0/0 | [0x80000054, 0x80000000, 0x80000000, 0, 0] |

<Callout type="info">
  Native SegWit (BIP84) addresses start with "bc1" and offer the lowest transaction fees.
</Callout>

## Supported Operations

### Getting Bitcoin Addresses

To generate and display a Bitcoin address on your KeepKey device:

```js filename="get-bitcoin-address.js" {9-14}
import { KeepKeySdk } from '@keepkey/keepkey-sdk';

// Initialize SDK
const sdk = await KeepKeySdk.create({
  apiKey: "bitcoin-app",
  pairingInfo: { name: "Bitcoin Wallet", url: window.location.origin }
});

// Bitcoin Native SegWit (BIP84): m/84'/0'/0'/0/0
const bitcoinParams = {
  addressNList: [0x80000054, 0x80000000, 0x80000000, 0, 0],
  coin: 'Bitcoin',
  scriptType: 'p2wpkh', // Native SegWit
  showDisplay: true     // Will show address on KeepKey device for verification
};

// Get Bitcoin address
const btcAddress = await sdk.btcGetAddress({ 
  bitcoinGetAddress: bitcoinParams 
});

console.log("Your Bitcoin address:", btcAddress);
```

### Sending Bitcoin

To create and sign a transaction to send Bitcoin:

```js filename="send-bitcoin.js" {8-16}
import { KeepKeySdk } from '@keepkey/keepkey-sdk';

// Initialize SDK
const sdk = await KeepKeySdk.create({
  apiKey: "bitcoin-app"
});

// Transaction parameters
const txParams = {
  coin: 'Bitcoin',
  inputs: [...], // The UTXOs to spend
  outputs: [{
    address: "bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdq",
    amount: "10000" // Amount in satoshis (0.0001 BTC)
  }],
  feeSatPerKb: "8000" // 8 sat/byte
};

// Sign and broadcast transaction
const result = await sdk.btcSignTx({ 
  btcSignTx: txParams 
});

console.log("Transaction ID:", result.txid);
```

## Address Validation

Ensuring a Bitcoin address is valid before sending funds is crucial:

```js
// Check if a Bitcoin address is valid
const isValid = await sdk.validateAddress({
  coin: 'Bitcoin',
  address: 'bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdq'
});

if (isValid) {
  console.log("Address is valid");
} else {
  console.log("Invalid address");
}
```

## Common Questions

### Which address type should I use?

We recommend using **Native SegWit (bc1...)** addresses for Bitcoin when possible, as they provide:
- Lower transaction fees
- Better security features
- Wider adoption and compatibility

### How can I verify my Bitcoin address on the device?

When generating an address with `showDisplay: true`, your KeepKey will display the address on its screen. Always verify this matches what you see in your application.

### What is the maximum amount of Bitcoin I can store?

There is no limit to how much Bitcoin you can store on your KeepKey. Since the device only stores your private keys, not the actual coins, you can secure any amount of Bitcoin.
