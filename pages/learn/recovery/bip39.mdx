Here's a list of tips to help you custody your recovery phrase securely:

Ensure that your 24-word recovery phrase is obtained from your Ledger device's screen during the initial setup. Your recovery words do not come in the box. The set of recovery sheets included in the box should be blank.
Do not make a digital copy of your recovery phrase. Do not take a picture of your phrase. Do not save your phrase into a password manager. Your recovery phrase needs to stay strictly offline.
When first writing down your recovery phrase, make sure to number each word correctly. Use a ballpen and not a pencil. Use capital letters, they are easier to read. Make sure each recovery word is correctly spelled by using the BIP-39 list.
Always keep a physical copy of your recovery phrase. Memorizing your recovery phrase is not a safe strategy for long-term cold storage
Do not scramble your recovery words.
Do not seed your Ledger 24-word recovery phrase into Metamask. This would compromise your phrase.
Do not seed your Metamask 12-word recovery phrase into your Ledger device. Your Metamask recovery phrase was generated online. As such, it is not secure. Seeding it into your Ledger device would compromise all the Ledger accounts that are derived from that recovery phrase.
Be cautious of scams falsely promoted as Ledger endorsements. Ledger never supports airdrops which can be covers for scams aiming at tricking you into revealing your recovery phrase. If an offer seems too good to be true, it likely is.
Learn to protect yourself against physical attacks. More on this here.
Learn how your recovery phrase works under the hood by watching this video.
Consider backing up your recovery phrase with a Crypto Steel Capsule Solo.
Losing your Secret Recovery Phrase and your Ledger device means losing access to your wallet. With Ledger Recover, provided by Coincover, you can protect and restore access to your wallet wherever you need it.
How to protect your PIN code?
Like your recovery phrase, your PIN code must be chosen during the device's initial setup. A strong PIN is key to the security of your Ledger accounts.

Always choose your PIN code yourself. Never use a PIN code you did not choose yourself.
Always enter your PIN code out of sight and away from prying eyes.
Do not store your PIN code on your computer or phone.
Change your PIN code if you believe it's been compromised. Learn more.
Remember that typing three wrong PINs in a row will reset your Ledger device. If this happens, your only option is to restore your accounts by using your recovery phrase.
How to choose a strong PIN code?
An 8-digit PIN is more secure than a 4-digit PIN.
Choose a PIN that's hard to guess. Easy-to-guess PIN codes like 0000, 12345678, or 55555555 are not secure.
Do not choose your date of birth as a PIN code.
Advanced security features
Maximize your account security with a passphrase (this feature is only recommended for advanced users).



Prior to bip39 bitcoind would save keypairs into a file. it would save to disk and you would have to save that file, if you lost that file you lost your money
generated to many addresses? need to save that file again

lost device? lost funds

corrupted file?
lost


Bip39 (and bip32) allows a durable and stateless recovery method for your wallet

It is the most important tool for self custody. its innovation is critical to prevent lost funds that haunted the ecosystem prior to its prevelence

it also is how you can

# Understanding BIP39: Technical Deep Dive

## Historical Context

### Pre-BIP39 Challenges
Before BIP39's introduction, cryptocurrency wallets faced several critical issues:

1. **Key Management Problems**
   - Individual private keys stored in wallet.dat files
   - No standardized backup format
   - Each new address required new backup
   - High risk of data corruption
   - No deterministic key generation

2. **Recovery Limitations**
   - Lost files meant permanent loss
   - No cross-wallet compatibility
   - Complex backup procedures
   - No standardized recovery method

## BIP39 Technical Implementation

### Entropy to Mnemonic Process

1. **Initial Entropy Generation**
   - 128 to 256 bits of random data
   - Generated using cryptographically secure RNG
   - Entropy sizes and corresponding word counts:
     ```
     128 bits → 12 words
     160 bits → 15 words
     192 bits → 18 words
     224 bits → 21 words
     256 bits → 24 words
     ```

2. **Checksum Creation**
   - SHA256 hash of entropy
   - First `ENT/32` bits used
   - Appended to original entropy

3. **Word Selection**
   - Combined bits split into 11-bit groups
   - Each group maps to word from 2048-word list
   - Standardized wordlist ensures compatibility

### Seed Generation

1. **PBKDF2 Parameters**
   - Hash Function: HMAC-SHA512
   - Iterations: 2048 rounds
   - Salt: "mnemonic" + optional passphrase
   - Output: 512-bit seed

2. **Current Limitations**
   - 2048 rounds considered low by modern standards
   - Limited by hardware wallet processing power
   - Future improvements planned with hardware advances

## Security Considerations

### Physical Security

1. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Use permanent ink
   - Write in CAPITAL letters
   - Number words sequentially
   - Verify against official wordlist
   ```
   1. WORD
   2. WORD
   3. WORD
   ...
   24. WORD
   ```

2. **Storage Recommendations**
   - Fireproof/waterproof container
   - Multiple secure locations
   - Consider metal backup solutions
   - Avoid digital storage

### Digital Security

1. **Strict Offline Policy**
   - No digital copies
   - No cloud storage
   - No password managers
   - No screenshots or photos

2. **Cross-Platform Considerations**
   - Never mix hardware and software wallets
   - Don't import hardware wallet seeds to software
   - Avoid online seed generation
   - Use only official wallet software

## Advanced Features

### Passphrase Protection

1. **Technical Implementation**
   - Additional entropy layer
   - Combined with seed during derivation
   - Creates unique deterministic wallet
   - No "wrong" passphrase (all valid)

2. **Security Properties**
   - Plausible deniability
   - Protection against physical theft
   - Additional brute-force protection
   - Multiple wallet capability

### BIP39 Extensions

1. **Multi-Language Support**
   - Standardized wordlists
   - Language-specific implementations
   - Cross-language compatibility
   - Checksum verification

2. **Integration with Other BIPs**
   - BIP32 (HD Wallets)
   - BIP44 (Multi-Account Hierarchy)
   - BIP49 (SegWit Support)
   - BIP84 (Native SegWit)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Recovery Process

1. **Device Setup**
   - Initialize in secure environment
   - Verify each word on device screen
   - Double-check word order
   - Test recovery before use

2. **Verification Steps**
   - Small test transaction
   - Recovery simulation
   - Address verification
   - Passphrase testing (if used)

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Security Risks**
   - Word order scrambling
   - Digital backups
   - Weak passphrases
   - Untested backups

2. **Usage Errors**
   - Missing words
   - Incorrect spelling
   - Wrong word order
   - Improper storage

## Future Developments

### Planned Improvements

1. **Security Enhancements**
   - Increased PBKDF2 rounds
   - Enhanced entropy generation
   - Improved backup methods
   - Hardware acceleration

2. **User Experience**
   - Better recovery mechanisms
   - Simplified backup procedures
   - Enhanced verification methods
   - Improved cross-wallet compatibility

> **Technical Note:** While 2048 PBKDF2 rounds is currently a limitation, the security of BIP39 primarily relies on the initial entropy and proper seed phrase protection. Future hardware improvements will enable increased iteration counts without compromising device performance.
