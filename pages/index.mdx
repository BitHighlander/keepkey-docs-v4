## ⚠️ Critical Security Warnings

### Recovery Phrase Protection

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
    <Image
        src="/Art/KeepKey_privacy.jpeg"
        alt="Privacy and Security"
        width={400}
        height={300}
    />
</div>

Your recovery phrase is the master key to all your assets. Critical rules:

1. **Never Share**
   - No support staff will ask for it
   - Not even KeepKey employees
   - No legitimate recovery service needs it
   - Keep it completely private

2. **Verify Sources**
   - Only use official KeepKey software
   - Download from verified sources
   - Check digital signatures
   - Validate firmware updates

3. **Common Attack Vectors**
   ```
   ❌ Support requests for recovery phrase
   ❌ Unofficial recovery tools
   ❌ Fake wallet apps
   ❌ "Helpful" direct messages
   ❌ Emergency support claims
   ```
