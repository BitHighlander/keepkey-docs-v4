Beware of scammers
The Internet is full of scammers.

They might contact you by pretending to be someone from KeepKey Support and asking for your 12-word recovery phrase.
Never share your 12-word recovery phrase, even with KeepKey Support.

Does KeepKey Support need my recovery phrase to help me solve technical issues?

* No, the KeepKey Support team does not need to know your 24-word recovery phrase to help you.

* Anyone trying to access your recovery phrase should be considered a scammer.
Please never share your recovery phrase with anyone, including Ledger.

* Anyone pointing to wallet or application that does wallet recovery that is not official KeepKey software should be avoided

* Official Software will always follow the recover cypher flow
