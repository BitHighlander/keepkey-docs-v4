### Step 2: Unbox Your KeepKey
1. **Unwrap**
- Check that the security seal is unbroken. If it is broken, contact support and do not use the device.
2. **Open**
- The box should include:
- KeepKey Device
- USB Cable
- Backup Phrase Card
- Warranty Pamphlet
3. **Plug in Device**
- Plug the device into your PC or laptop. KeepKey is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

> **Note:** First, write down your 12-word Seed Phrase on the provided card. This phrase will only be shown once, so write it down now.

### Step 3: Open the Desktop Application and Update Your Device
- Follow the prompts on both the Desktop Application and the device screen to update.

### Step 4: Backup Your Seed Phrase
- Refer to the "Get Started" video if you need help setting up your PIN.
- **Windows users** may need to click on "More info" and then "Run anyway" to install the latest versions.
- **Seed Storage Tip:** Some boxes include an engraver for a more durable storage solution. **Store your Seed Phrase securely!** This phrase is your wallet backup and is compatible with any BIP39-compliant wallet.

### Step 5: Master Your KeepKey - The KeepKey PIN Cypher

1. **BIP39 Standard**
- **BIP39** defines how wallets generate seed phrases and encryption keys, simplifying key management.
- **Passphrase Option**
BIP39 allows an optional passphrase for extra security. Be careful, as losing this passphrase could lead to losing access to your funds.
- **Mnemonic Sentence**

A set of 12 or 24 words generated from random numbers, making them nearly impossible to guess due to the vast number of combinations.

2. **KeepKey PIN Entry Process**
- A cipher is displayed on the device, representing the PIN layout. Enter the PIN by pressing the corresponding locations in the KeepKey Desktop Application.
