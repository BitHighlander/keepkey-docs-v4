# Understanding Crypto Fees

![Transaction Fees](/images/desktop/transaction-fees.png)

When using cryptocurrencies with your KeepKey and ShapeShift, understanding fees is important. This guide explains the basics of crypto fees in simple terms.

## Types of Fees in Crypto

When using ShapeShift with your KeepKey, you'll encounter two main types of fees:

### 1. Network Fees

These are fees paid to the blockchain network (not to ShapeShift) to process your transaction:

- **What they are**: Payments to miners/validators who process transactions
- **Who sets them**: Determined by network demand and congestion
- **When you pay**: Every time you send crypto or make a trade

### 2. Exchange Fees

These may apply when trading one cryptocurrency for another:

- **What they are**: Fees for using exchange services
- **Who sets them**: The exchange platforms
- **When you pay**: Only when trading between different cryptocurrencies

## How Fees Work in Different Cryptocurrencies

### Bitcoin Fees

- Based on transaction size (in virtual bytes)
- Higher during network congestion
- You can choose fee levels (economy, average, priority)
- Typically range from $0.50 to $5+ depending on network conditions

### Ethereum Fees

- Called "gas fees"
- Based on computational complexity of the transaction
- Measured in "gwei" (a fraction of ETH)
- Can be very high during network congestion

### Other Cryptocurrencies

- Each blockchain has its own fee structure
- Some newer blockchains have very low fees
- Some have fixed fees regardless of congestion

## Fee Selection in ShapeShift

When sending crypto in ShapeShift, you can usually choose between fee levels:

1. **Economy**: Lowest cost, longer wait time
   - Best for: Non-urgent transactions
   - Wait time: Could be hours or longer

2. **Average**: Balanced cost and speed
   - Best for: Standard transactions
   - Wait time: Usually within an hour

3. **Priority**: Highest cost, fastest confirmation
   - Best for: Urgent transactions
   - Wait time: Usually within minutes

## Fee Transparency

ShapeShift always shows you fees upfront before you confirm any transaction:

- Network fees are displayed before you send
- Trading fees and rates are shown before you trade
- No hidden charges or surprise fees

## Tips for Managing Fees

### For Sending

- **Timing**: Fees are often lower during weekends and off-peak hours
- **Batching**: Consider combining multiple sends into one transaction
- **Fee Level**: Choose economy for non-urgent transactions

### For Trading

- **Compare**: Check the total cost including network fees
- **Trade Size**: Larger trades often have better fee-to-value ratios
- **Asset Choice**: Some assets have lower network fees than others

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
  <summary><strong>Why are fees sometimes high and sometimes low?</strong></summary>
  <div style={{ padding: '1rem' }}>
    Fees fluctuate based on network demand. When many people are using a blockchain, fees increase as users compete to have their transactions processed first. During quieter periods, fees decrease.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Does ShapeShift charge fees?</strong></summary>
  <div style={{ padding: '1rem' }}>
    ShapeShift itself doesn't charge platform fees for basic operations. The fees you pay go to the blockchain networks and, in the case of trades, to the decentralized exchanges that facilitate the swaps.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can I avoid paying fees?</strong></summary>
  <div style={{ padding: '1rem' }}>
    Network fees are unavoidable when using blockchains, but you can minimize them by choosing economy fee levels and transacting during periods of low network congestion.
