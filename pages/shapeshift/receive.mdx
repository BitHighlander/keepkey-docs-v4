## Detailed Instructions

### 1. Select Your Asset

After connecting your KeepKey to ShapeShift:

- Find the asset you want to receive in your portfolio list
- Click on the asset to view its details
- Click the "Receive" button

### 2. Verify the Address on Your KeepKey

<div style={{ 
  background: '#0f0', 
  color: '#000', 
  padding: '1rem', 
  borderRadius: '0.5rem', 
  marginBottom: '1rem',

</div>

- ShapeShift will display a receiving address
- Your KeepKey will show the same address on its screen
- Carefully compare both addresses to ensure they match
- Press the button on your KeepKey to confirm

### 3. Share Your Address

Once verified, you can:
- Copy the address to your clipboard
- Display as QR code for in-person transfers
- Share via your preferred messaging app

The sender will need this exact address to send you cryptocurrency.

## Understanding Addresses

- Each cryptocurrency has its own address format
- Addresses are long strings of letters and numbers
- You can generate a new address for each transaction for better privacy
- All addresses in your account will always remain accessible

## Tracking Your Transaction

After someone sends cryptocurrency to your address:

1. The transaction will first appear as "Pending"
2. After sufficient confirmations, it will show as "Confirmed"
3. The time for confirmation varies by cryptocurrency:
   - Bitcoin: ~10-60 minutes
   - Ethereum: ~15 seconds to 5 minutes
   - Other assets: varies by blockchain

You can track the status of your transaction in the "Activity" tab of ShapeShift.
