2. The amount you're trading
3. The asset you're receiving

Carefully verify each detail before pressing the button on your KeepKey to confirm.

## Understanding Trading with ShapeShift

### How It Works

ShapeShift connects to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to find the best rates for your trades. When you make a trade:

1. Your assets never leave your control
2. The trade is executed through smart contracts
3. The exchanged assets are sent directly to your KeepKey

### Trading Fees

There are two types of fees to be aware of:

1. **Network Fees**: Paid to the blockchain networks to process transactions
2. **Exchange Fees**: Typically a small percentage of the trade amount

ShapeShift shows you all fees upfront before you confirm your trade.

## Trading Tips

- **Compare Rates**: ShapeShift shows you the current exchange rate, but rates can fluctuate
- **Consider Network Congestion**: During busy times, network fees may be higher
- **Start Small**: If you're new to trading, start with smaller amounts until you're comfortable
- **Check Liquidity**: Some trading pairs may have limited liquidity, affecting rates
